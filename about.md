I am a second year Computer Science PhD Student at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) supervised by [Alan Blair](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~blair/). My primary research topic is Deep Reinforcement Learning, specifically in ways RL methods can be applied to tasks in the NLP domain (mostly Question Answering). 

Prior to UNSW I studied a BE/ME in Electrical Engineering at UQ, and a MSc in Electrical Engineering at TUM, where I did some work on [artificial skin](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01691864.2015.1095652) for robots.
